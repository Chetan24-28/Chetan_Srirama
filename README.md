#  CampusPulse Initiative – Task 1 (Coding Week '25, IIT Guwahati)

Welcome to the CampusPulse Initiative, part of the Machine Learning challenge organized during Coding Week 2025 by the Coding Club, IIT Guwahati. This repository contains all work related to task 1


##  Objective

Analyze and model student lifestyle, academic, and social data to:

- Identify anonymized survey features.
- Clean and prepare the dataset.
- Generate meaningful exploratory insights.
- Build and evaluate predictive models.
- Interpret and explain model decisions with transparency.

##  Task Breakdown

###  Level 1: Variable Identification Protocol
- Used EDA techniques (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) to infer the meanings of `Feature_1`, `Feature_2`, `Feature_3`.
- Justified feature identities based on statistical patterns and correlations.

###  Level 2: Data Integrity Audit
- Detected missing values and anomalies.
- Applied suitable imputation techniques (mean, mode, regression-based) with justification.

###  Level 3: Exploratory Insight Report
- Posed 5+ analytical questions.
- Visualized and interpreted student lifestyle and wellness factors using bar charts, violin plots, etc.

###  Level 4: Relationship Prediction Model
- Framed a classification problem to predict relationship status.
- Used models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and others.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

###  Level 5: Model Reasoning & Interpretation
- Used SHAP to understand global and local model decisions.
- Visualized decision boundaries for selected classifiers using 2D feature projections.
- Provided plain-language explanations of what drives model predictions.


##  Requirements
